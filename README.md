Well, hello. You've made it to my secret hub of operations.
You may be one of the first. You got here by inspecting outgoing connections by Triage or Wireshark. You found it leads to a strange GET request from a GitHub page.
This is actually something pretty important. Here is my "control switch" for Vizzle Executor. If the status is false, execution or even injection are disabled forcing it into a de-facto disabled state.
If you hoped to find something malicious, well, I can promise to you there isn't anything malicious.
